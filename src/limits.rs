//! Process-wide limits for heavy indexing work.
//!
//! `codesearch serve` hosts many repos, and each repo's refresh/reindex pass
//! is CPU- and memory-heavy: file reads, tree-sitter chunking, ONNX
//! embedding, HNSW graph construction. Without a process-wide budget, N repos
//! with work start N concurrent passes — every core is saturated, and N
//! file/chunk windows are held in memory at once even though ONNX inference
//! itself already serialises on the per-model mutex.
//!
//! This module provides one shared budget ([`JobGate`]) plus the per-inference
//! and per-batch knobs that bound what a single job costs:
//!
//! | Variable | Default | Meaning |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | `CODESEARCH_INDEX_JOBS` | `1` | Max concurrent heavy repo jobs per process |
//! | `CODESEARCH_EMBED_THREADS` | unset (ONNX default = all cores) | ONNX intra-op threads per session |
//! | `CODESEARCH_EMBED_PAUSE_MS` | `0` | Pause between background embedding mini-batches |
//! | `CODESEARCH_MIN_FREE_MB` | `0` (off) | Free-memory floor before a job may start |
//! | `CODESEARCH_MAX_CHUNKS_PER_BATCH` | `0` (off) | Hard cap on chunks held per refresh batch |
//!
//! All values are read from the environment so a systemd unit or shell can set
//! them without a config file. See the README section "Indexing limits" for
//! recommended values on shared machines.
//!
//! The gate is attached to [`crate::index::SharedStores`] at open time in
//! serve mode; standalone processes (CLI index, `codesearch mcp`) leave it
//! `None` and behave exactly as before.
